Online Shopping Service
Luai Iwidat & Mohannad Jamal

Our project will be an online shopping web service to buy and sell things online.
The items that will be sold are targeted for houses, mostly furniture. Data will
be stored as objects resembling different kinds of items with their details, such
as name, price, room, type of material and other things. Also, users who use the
service are stored too, including their usernames and wallet.
